This is the repository for the official website of BudWorks.

## Development

### Key Tools

This project utilizes Vercel's [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework with integrated [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/), plus [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) (`.scss`) for styling. We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) as our package manager, [ESLint](https://eslint.org) for linting, and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting. Any other open source tools not listed here can be viewed in the package.json file.

### Setting Up the Website

As mentioned, this project uses Yarn as it's package manager. In order to utilize Yarn and TypeScript, you must have the TypeScript compiler and Yarn installed globally. You can accomplish this by running `npm install -g yarn typescript` in a terminal with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
